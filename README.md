# Color TFT
Driver for the 18 bit TFT color displays.

Intended to drive the ILI9341,
ILI9488, ST7789V and ST7735 modules in 4-wire SPI mode.  Initially tested
with the 240x320 ST7789V as seen on the ESP-WROVER-KIT v3.

The 320x240 TFT on the M5Stack is an ILI9341 (or 9342 according to some docs).

The display on the LillyGo T-Wristband is an ST7735.
